These moments are one in a million. The
odds of this happening are insane. When
you're not satisfied with knocking down
all the pins in just one lane, you feel
compelled to help the other guy out as
well. When you're supposed to chop down
a tree, but you end up planting one
instead.
[Music]
After a disappointing 2022, this is me
dodging toxic relationships in the new
year. This is the city's way of telling
you to lose a few pounds.
Oh my god, bro. Hell,
you know you've spent too long avoiding
the gym when you try and smash a wine
bottle and fail.
Mission failed. We'll get him next time.
This guy's mom was concerned that
skateboarding was too dangerous, so she
asked him to try a two-wheeler instead.
He understood the assignment.
This is what a level 100 volleyball
player really looks like.
When you're doing some spring cleaning,
but you're also interested in planting
trees for the environment.
Do me a favor, please. Get out of here.
This might just be the first time a slow
motion replay was actually necessary.
Oh,
the number one rule on a roller coaster
first day is catch phones, not feelings.
When attempting the world's highest hip
jump, David Wise not only broke the
record, he sailed right over the top of
it.
[Music]
They say if you can't beat them, dazzle
them. And this guy just did both. The
goalkeepers still can't believe what
just happened.
At this lake, the fish are offering a
buy one get one free promotion, but only
while stocks last. When you've got
football practice, but you also need to
study for the exam this afternoon, you
are watching a master at work.
What you're looking at here is the real
Spider-Man on his day off.
Next time someone says you're blocking
their shot, just smile and show them
this video.
Fishing is a skill that requires years
of experience. Unless the fish you're
trying to catch has lost the will to
live.
This machine is the ultimate test of
reflexes and peripheral vision. And this
woman somehow nails both.
[Music]
Yeah, sure this looks impressive, but
there are easier ways to hand your
friend a can of shaken up beer.
Nice shot. When you've still got three
axe throws left and the attendant tells
you they close in 30 seconds, you got to
do what you got to do.
Snowboarding is a lot like life. Just
when you think you failed, it might
actually be a win in disguise.
Some people might call this luck. Others
would check if the table's flat. One
thing's for sure, though. It's
definitely an efficient way to play
pool.
Yeah, boy.
How to turn an epic fail into a win in 3
seconds or less.
This guy's routine is already
impressive, but just wait until you see
what all that raw power eventually does.
At this point, I'm beginning to think
that tires secretly hate all
pedestrians.
He needs some milk.
One thing we can all agree on, this has
to be the most perfect high five you'll
ever see.
That's definitely one way to load your
favorite game into the Xbox. Sometimes
the simplest trick shots are the most
impressive.
Oh yeah.
On a list of the most annoying people,
slow walkers are only beaten by people
that stop dead in their tracks.
This meeting of men on tiny chairs was
suddenly interrupted by a massive
sinkhole opening up.
They say that cricket and boxing are
very similar sports. You got to get the
duck and weave down pat.
Oh, you stink.
So, what do you think?
So, I
Baby, you were this close to being
single.
No matter how badly you mess up, the
universe is determined to see you
succeed.
This guy thought he was setting up for
an amazing trick shot, but instead
ruined a perfectly good camera. Damn.
At the end of each season, players that
have scored zero goals don't win a
trophy. So, naturally, this goalkeeper
took it as a challenge.
Sometimes it's just not your game. No
matter how many shots on target you
have, you'll still find a way to
embarrass yourself. The driver of this
runaway car has obviously spent a lot of
time playing Frogger. What the hell?
This car thought it was just another
Wednesday afternoon drive. They never
thought they'd have to be dodging
tractor tires.
Bye. Have a great time.
Talk about too close for comfort. This
cyclist narrowly missed being collected
by the reversing white car.
Rugby fans are some of the most generous
people in sport. And here's proof.
You either clean the snow off the roof
yourself or you live long enough to
almost be hit by it.
Big dog. We got a situation here. I'm
going to need some backup.
This guy's lining up the final shot to
take out a game of pool. All he needs to
do is tap the black ball in without
sinking the white.
This downhill skier was narrowly missed
by a malfunctioning drone that just
couldn't keep up. Yet another
unsuccessful drone strike. Something
tells me he won't be using the elevator
for a while.
[Music]
They say that drive-throughs are the
quickest and safest ways to go shopping.
What they don't tell you is how tiring
it can be. When you bend it so well,
even Beckham would be proud. Not even
the keeper thought it was going in.
Instead,
off work in
this is living proof that parents have
superhuman abilities when it comes to
their kids.
This guy thought he was reeling in the
catch of a lifetime, but instead caught
1,000 lbs of nope with teeth.
This guy came within inches of getting a
brand new fade on the back of his neck.
Talk about a fresh cut. No bottle
opener, no problem. All you need is a
buddy and a bike.
Perfect.
This picture took inspiration from Neo
of the Matrix.
If you've ever wondered why houses take
so long to get built, it's because
contractors spend all day like this
getting hammered.
Mission accomplished. Good work.
Spending a Saturday night home alone
with Corona used to mean something
completely different. Murphy's law
states that if you're unemployed long
enough, anything's possible. Even trick
shots as amazing as these. This guy
thought he'd wiped out in front of a
crowd and lost his board. Luckily, his
friend was there to lend a hand.
This guy was just heading to work when
his day took a really bad turn.
This guy could always take up
professional surfing if racing doesn't
work out. He's already got the balance.
You might just need something that
floats better than a bike.
When you identify as a control freak and
you can't trust anyone on your team to
do their job right for this next shot,
white ball in the extreme corner pocket.
Like they say, any hole is a goal.
In this football match, an innocent dive
nearly turned deadly. But thanks to the
quick thinking of his opponent, everyone
went home safely.
Piping hot pizza pies coming straight
out of the oven, and faces generally
don't mix. Good thing for his quick
reflexes.
Hitting one balloon with a bow and arrow
is impressive, but hitting 10 balloons
with 10 arrows simultaneously, that's
got to be close to impossible, right?
Blink and you'll miss it. This catcher's
no look catch behind the back is a one
ina million.
This determined defender put her body on
the line to make sure her team didn't
lose the point.
In volleyball, the best defense is
keeping your opposition always guessing
about your next move.
Psych. That's the wrong number.
It's probably not the smartest idea to
be holding metal rods in the middle of a
thunderstorm.
This extreme tuber is all about
high-speed maneuvers and no regrets.
Unless he lets go, that is. This guy can
shoot five different targets in a time
quicker than it takes most people to
scratch their nose. When you're asked to
go down to the store and pick up some
top shelf cat food, this is what they
mean. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Nope.
It's a high-speed projectile. Get out of
the way. If you think the safest place
to hide from an archer is behind a wall,
think again.
When this snowboarder mistimed his jump
and tapped the lip, he never knew it
would cause this to happen. Luck or
skill, you decide. The rules of AFL
state that the player in possession must
bounce the ball every few steps, even if
there's a pigeon in the way.
