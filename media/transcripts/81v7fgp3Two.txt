these are superhumans in real life they
do things no one can no CGI trickery
needed is Darth Vader this Skywalker's
father
Man is real he's not contained in the
pages of your comic book He's Alive and
Well and living in Indonesia dietitians
recommend you drink about half a gallon
of water each day that lands chugs Nails
a full gallon in under 60 Seconds
you're looking at a real life machine in
motion his Furious Fists are flying five
times a second
hey Eddie can you beat the high score on
the punching machine nah he'll just use
Rob power and Brute Force to smash it
into Oblivion
this guy empties magazines faster than
he can load them and he's dead accurate
too
they say Bruce Lee was the greatest but
after seeing this guy nail four board
breaks and one 720 spinning kick I'm not
so sure these folded mats are said to
have the same thickness and density as
human flesh let that sink in for a
moment remember when you were a kid and
the floor was made of lava this guy
never lost not even once
there's no wall tall enough that can
contain this sort of freakish athlete
the rules of physics just don't apply to
him
the next time you hit your funny bone on
the corner of the table spare thought
for this Sensei this Archer gives us the
hold my beer look while he hits 10
balloons with 10 arrows in a single shot
apart from his next level coordination
and reflexes there's one thing we know
about this guy he really hates wasting
arrows remember the small kid who you
picked last for the school baseball team
well now he's out to get his revenge
this guy might just be the real life
gambit turning playing cards into deadly
weapons he flicks cards faster than you
can pitch a ball and can slice a pee in
half midair when life hands you a skull
that's 2.3 times thicker than the
average human think of the money you'll
save on never having to buy a hammer
from the hardware store I'm not sure
what coconuts ever did to this guy but
it was enough for him to want to smash
everyone on site no harness no safety
net no chances
folding a frying pan into a crepe looks
super easy when your hands are as big as
Andre the Giants you spend a decade
practicing and not be anywhere near as
good as this guy for him Dance Dance
Revolution is a lifestyle this girl's
proof that there's no limit to how low
someone will stoop she's literally
playing limbo on expert mode
for this guy normal push-ups are way too
mainstream he's gotta add in the threat
of missing the Shelf falling or
dislocating a shoulder
[Music]
with a strict shampoo and conditioner
regiment you too could have hair strong
enough to pull a double decker bus with
32 people on board who needs a forklift
when you have this guy
when your washing machine is on the
fritz you got to throw it onto the
garbage pile only these guys can hit the
curb from your front door this guy's
vertical leap is off the scale it almost
doesn't look real
I think this dude seen one too many Mr
Bean reruns all I know for sure is that
the man's the king of parallel parking
running on two feet is so boring this
guy channels his inner Beast by
Galloping down the straight on all fours
faster than most people can run on two
How Low Can You Go probably nowhere near
as low as this record-breaking roller
limbo lady would you have legs as strong
as tree trunks you have to step up your
squat routine and start training with a
buddy on your shoulders this takes the
trust circle to the next level
home
not to be outdone this guy shows perfect
pull-up form using nothing but his pinky
fingers
this is probably the only other dude in
history to literally walk on water
there's something completely unnerving
about watching a contortionist in action
it's like something out of your worst
nightmare only you can't look away your
eyes aren't deceiving you that's a jumbo
jetty's dragging around he could win a
tug of war against 10 men by himself
this guy's mastered the one inch punch a
move that doesn't sound so scary until
you see it in action rumor has it that
Cannon Ryu from Street Fighter were
modeled after these two kicking
prodigies
it takes a lifetime of dedication to The
Shaolin discipline to have sticks broken
over your head without batting an eyelid
Ted takes the term hard-headed a little
too literally by caving in concrete
blocks with his head is this real life
there's no way any normal human being
can move their feet this fast
one throwing ax Bullseye is a flu but
two simultaneously now that's accurate
this is proof that the hand is quicker
than the eye
[Music]
don't be fooled by appearances you're
looking at a guy who holds over 35
martial arts World Records you never
know who could be a mild-mannered
assassin Mr T hasn't faded in his
Twilight years his hair May resemble his
pearly white teeth but they're stronger
than ever Rocky Balboa ran up some
stairs big deal it would have been even
more impressive with Apollo Creed upside
down on top of his head okay I'll admit
it Fruit Ninja gets pretty addictive but
this guy takes the phone game so
seriously he had to become a real-life
melon Masher there's threading the
needle between a set of cones and then
there's these guys
it's not a real workout unless you
punish the ABS of your training buddy in
between sets if you're not punching his
six-pack after push-ups or sit-ups you
can always get the same result with a
watermelon don't let the random Oompa
Loompa distract you what you're looking
at is the very peak of human Stone
skipping abilities this bodybuilder has
boyfriend bench pressing down to an art
and what do you want to do after you've
lifted all those men toss them to the
side Ronaldo and Messi have nothing on
this woman's ball control or should I
say iPad
I'm not sure legs are supposed to bend
that way unless your bones are made of
plasticine and your dad's name is Gumby
surely this guy gets a round of applause
after pumping out
1140 claps in a minute he sounds like an
auditorium Standing Ovation after the
Encore if this guy can break three
baseball bats with the force of his heel
hook just think about how mangled your
leg would be if you get on his bad side
if this mountain of a man can make
watermelons look as fragile as broken
eggs then one slap would put you six
feet under walking across hot coals has
been done to death wanna really impress
me use fragile light bulbs as a
tightrope yeah why oh how the tables
turned now it's time for the tugboat to
get pulled this guy's using just one
finger to move this massive Hall move
over Hawkeye we have a new Avenger in
town for those counting at home that's
seven consecutive arrows shot through a
keyhole I heard you like french fries
not as much as this guy
foreign
[Music]
six hundred and twenty one fries
weighing almost seven pounds in a shade
over 20 minutes this guy is yet another
Master with a hatred for coconuts
touch typing is hard enough but hitting
163 words a minute that's insane a true
example of what's possible when you're a
Reddit regular
so how many plates do you want to leg
press today all of them foreign
s are busy wave a load of strangers with
your scapulars totally normal
want to know how to snack like a ninja
here's a hot tip Oreos dipped in milk
tastes better when you're Defying
Gravity when kickboxing training gets
boring it's time to get creative now
just imagine how much damage those kicks
would do if the tires were an opponent
I'll get neutralized when the snack
machine eats your money and you don't
get your bag of Doritos it's time to
give it a stop and show it who's boss
running late for work is no issue for
this guy who Nails a full breakfast of
noodles and boiled eggs in 10 seconds
flat
this snowboarder knows this run like the
back of his hand from grinding rails to
Limba Maneuvers to save himself from a
coat hanger injury this guy does it all
next time you see a guy squaring up to
kick you keep in mind he could just be
offering you a light
this guy's staff spins are enough to
make Darth Maul blush get this man a
lightsaber he has to save the Galaxy
masaki ikemiyagi one of the deadly
deadly at short distance these planks of
wood don't stand a chance 11 balls seem
like 10 too many to be able to keep up
in the air at one time that's 10 000
hours of practice paying off right there
I'm a bad boy
