this breaking
news if you're watching this right now
it means we've both been
murdered cuz recently some suspicious
things have been happening and we've
been documenting everything for the past
week to find out who has been trying to
kill us but now that we're dead it's up
to you guys to put the clues together
from the evidence Left Behind to catch
our killer and bring him to
Justice wait they're dead
everybody calm down we need to work
together to find the killer let's watch
the
video pause did you see that yeah
someone just moved on the
box oh guys he's in the
corner oh he's moving in the back trying
to escape he's literally sneaking out
behind a box guys turn around turn
around how' that even work how did they
not see him Noy that was pretty smart
sneak behind the box Alex he's got to be
in the house
[Music]
somewhere that's straight out of
Spider-Man that ceiling cannot hold
Tanner obviously we know the Killer is
stealthy and really good at hiding and
we know it's not tan cuz the ceilings
cannot carry him all
right because we know the Killer's great
at hiding we're going to be recreating
the crime scene by playing extreme
hideand-seek in boxes to determine who's
innocent and and who suss I'm going to
be seeking everybody you have 69
seconds this is going to be easy oh dude
he's never going to find me here both of
us in the same box why not 30 29 28 oh
this is perfect 26 25 24 I'm going to
hide in the pink one cuz it reminds me
of
Barbie should be a kiss
no 68 69 here I come I'm going to go for
this box
first wait I hear someone inside this
box are you running away I found the
first victim okay let's go find some
more
people I have a feeling someone's in one
of these boxes
wait there Caleb that was a pretty good
hiding spot dude you knocked me off my
ra you're out my next weapon is be
B oh
yeah I found
Le more of that later give me them
balls hope you can
swim oh hey hey hey what are to BL
BL you better come
out I broke the goop stick you have one
more chance to come out we're already
out what no I meant like the Box oh
dang I really missed out on the fun
there's only a few boxes
[Music]
left man wait there's only one box left
and it moved just like the killer let's
go see who it
is cat let's go back to the courtroom
this is Super
SU according to the hide-and-seek
challenge we've all determined that the
most guilty person is cat yeah why did
you kill my son w w it doesn't mean
she's guilty just yet we've also
determined that the most innocent person
is Ally she screamed first and was found
first you're free to
go girl
power oh wait what are you doing
here oh my God you're the Killer
[Applause]
[Music]
okay now let's watch the second piece of
evidence the twins Left Behind wait is
that a sword he's right there
refle God that would have taken both
their heads
off wait is that an old man whose
grandpa is that oh my God
oh he got
foot oh he's still going
oh oh that oh man this guy's tough I
still think it was Ally she wanted to
use Alan's credit card yeah that might
be based on the footage the killer was
able to maneuver to the top of the
stairs despite all the obstacles and
because of that we're going to be doing
a slippery stairs challenge to see which
one of us can make it to the top 3 2 one
cl this
is give me the
ball I'm just ping my L
leg get down here
oh
[Music]
god oh no oh
no
oh oh my I will I win
[Music]
wo I think we can all agree we're a
little shaken up from that last
challenge but the most sus one was sea
wait what the where's
sea sorry I was tickling them by no what
the not mine that's a different kind of
sus but the person who couldn't even
make it up the stairs and it's the most
innocent is Alan and Alex's mom a course
they are my sons I love them how could I
kill them I would even give my life for
them now let's go watch some more
[Music]
EP wait is that car following them yeah
that's got to be the kill coming
slow my God that was so close barely
surved how did they jump that like Jedi
wait is that my car
wait pause it pause it clearly the
killer can't
drive
what after watching the video and seeing
the killer miss us with the car the
suspects are now going to be recreating
the same crime scene by driving the same
car through these obstacles to determine
who's innocent and who sus this is going
to be a piece of cake but if Alex is one
of the obstacles no one's getting
through
wait there it is
that's that
sorry did I hit any people usually tell
me I drive like a girl I have no idea
what that means
though thankfully that wasn't an actual
person ladies this could be me picking
you
up supposed
to dude keeps getting worse oh no ever
take that guy he drives like a girl this
is my first time driving what just
kidding it's my second
oh my what the hell was that F that's
what I call a hidden
run where you
going is he way you going this is how I
drive the hose
crazy girl power
it's this is so
hard well I didn't do too
good hopefully I do good as my lover bro
I'm right
here you're driving like a girl wor
maybe I am the
killer I dve like that went right around
it
dude look at this throwing
off that's how you know I'm not a girl
cuz I can actually
drive according to everyone's driving
skills the person who didn't hit a
single mannequin making them the most
guilty is baits most guilty being a good
driver or not a woman makes me guilty
hey you need to watch your mouth for all
I know you guys are just hitting stuff
on
wo wo wo who turned off the lights who's
that who's there that who was
that what the hell
[Music]
[Music]
happened I know we're all shocked from
the tragedy we witnessed and now we know
the Killer is either bold or desperate
which means we are close and to prove
I'm innocent I'm going to show you guys
just howad I am with the sledgehammer
unlike the
killer what Caleb it was you you just
playing detective to throw us off no i i
k any of my friends how do you explain
that then uh it was a scientific swing
someone else
go oh my
God how could you kill him it was the
love of my life
[Music]
in the name of true
[Music]
love he's definitely capable of murder
in the Name of
Love where you learn how to do that you
learned a lot of things in
prison he's the killer I you give it to
the next
person that girl power girl power
activate C cat you can stop now cat
you're good cat you're
good now I'm good I put the girl in Girl
Power
yeah it was too heavy for me that was
embarrassing even for a girl hey you
watch your mouth hey you watch yours
girls are better than that you probably
killed I'm going to beat your ass you
killed
him my
turn what was that a sus move dude that
was a little too good my
sledgehammer
my we can agree we're all pretty good
with the sledgehammer but the suspect
who's the least guilty is Lani the only
thing I'm guilty of is at girl power
you're free to go
yes yeah F flower
W okay let's watch the next video he
came back wo minutes wait everything's
locked though you can't open it I just
don't get it who would want us dead and
why you won't give up get ins TI he's so
determined jump through the window how
did he do that he's good at putting in a
tight spaces I like to do that but it's
not
me Sean now you said kind of makes it
seem like is love you in prison Sean
no because we saw the killer jump
through a very tight space perfectly
we're also going to be jumping through
different impossible shape to determine
which one of us most resembles the
killer 3 2
[Applause]
1 that's the P perfectly that's so
you're the killer for sure what the hell
was
that I don't think she's the killer
[Music]
go hey that was pretty good he broke a
small piece though I guess I
scientifically miscalculated that a
little bit go hold my
wi didn't break
anything hey he just flew all the way to
the top of the sus list oh yeah 3 2
1
J should have got a bigger shake for him
oh
God 3 2 1
go believe that was horrible he broke
the entire tee that hurts my
balls give me some
balls based off the last challenge I
think I think it's very clear that the
most innocent person is B I don't like
tight places they remind me of prison I
ain't going back knew I
[Music]
make I never
[Music]
[Applause]
the all right let's play the rest of the
video
that oh they about to fight him they
they both got wait what
oh Alex Alex no Alex no wait that's how
Alex
died no Alex what are these Psychopaths
would have killed him it's not me why
the killer had to be pretty strong to
tackle someone that SI of Alex do you
have no sympathy K It Wasn't
Me based on the footage scientifically
speaking the Killer is obviously very
strong and heavy enough to break through
a table and because of that each of us
will be fighting the World's Strongest
Man to see how we do who's going to
fight me
first I'm going to get you Bubba
here so we he hasn't seen this girl
power girl power
fin that's
it come on ja come on attack come
on get him think about your lover come
on come on get
him
bam k
what the hell my hand my
ha win come on get oh scientifically
speaking I have 0% chance of
winning heavy toy
is that the best you've
got cat you surprisingly did pretty good
against a sumo wrestler Tanner he could
barely even pick you up and Sean I don't
know what the hell those moves were but
for me I'm crippled making me the most
innocent so I'm going to escort myself
out and ladies I can escort you to a
night of fun here my
line I wish I was a
lady let's finish the rest of the video
no oh the Killer's getting back up what
come
on doing he's not
even he
CAU oh my God just got knocked out
where's he taking him how could one of
you do this it was you huh those fake
tears are going to save you now I know
it was you
so we all saw the killer not flinch at
all when objects were being thrown at
him so we're going to be recreating the
crime scene by doing the try not to
Flinch challenge to determine who's
innocent and who Su 3 2 1
go okay try not to Flint three 2 1 go
[Applause]
need move that so scary Zach you're
about to kiss those balls
Goodbye Oh my
God a little bit of
[Music]
it cat you're the easiest one and you
still scream what happened to that girl
power looking back at the last challenge
the person who did not flinch was tan
woo let's go no that makes you guilty
what and the person who flinched and
screamed the most was cat you're good to
go bye bye bye cat that means the Killer
is one of us I don't trust either of you
guys I don't like your hair at least I'm
not fat Now give me the M let's see
where Allan got dragged off
to wait this looks like a jigsaw room
psychopath is it like a Escape or die
where am I Sherlock they got you too
it's Sheldon God damn
it hello gentlemen you may not know me
but I know you you both like challenges
so let's play a challenge for your lives
in 60 seconds this room will fill with a
poisonous gas unless you can escape
These Cuffs let the game
begin quick there's a song start cutting
it's not going to
work of
course he wants us to cut through our
foot you first hell no I always knew you
were a fake detective
never I was never a fake
detective oh
[Music]
I did
it what wrong
foot what wrong
foot it broke the
lock oh my God
[Music]
because we know the Killer is a
psychopath and really good with locks
we're going to chain oursel underwater
and see which one of us can escape three
2 1 go
I give up there's no way I could do
this I got it you already up that's a
little bit suspicious no we still got to
wait for
Tanner I did it I'm free wait you guys
already finished no but you two
did based on the investigation the
person who came up first makeing the
most most unlike the Killer is Zach
you're free to go once I find out which
one of you did it I'll go to prison and
finish you off
myself guess it's just me and you now
Kira who the hell is
Kira soda all right it's down to us two
now let's figure out who did it I'm
honestly done with all this I'm getting
the hell out of here I've been put on a
disguise so the killer have to recognize
me oh that's actually pretty
mine he just punched the
[Music]
wall I think he's
dead oh my oh he just spit out blood so
that's how he
died I'm not strong enough to do that
Tanner
because we know the Killer is strong
enough to break through a wall we're
also going to see which one of us is
strong enough to bust through this wall
I'll go first three 2 one
go big boy went through the wall I don't
know if I can do that damn that hurt
this ain't the first time I'm busting
today 3 2 one go
oh God are you okay I just bust a nut
what since I made it through the wall
we're both guilty so we got to call
everyone back and figure this
out guys I called this emergency meeting
because I believe we accidentally
declared the killer innocent wait wait
wait it it doesn't make any sense if
we're all here then it can only mean one
thing it's a trap
[Music]
[Music]
Alex I thought you died I took a pill to
temporarily slow down my heart and the
simplest involved paying people off like
an assassin for the perfect cover story
and when you guys were least expecting
it I finished the job but why cuz there
can only be one one of us please just
end my
suffering just kill
me just kill
me I hate
you I hate you
