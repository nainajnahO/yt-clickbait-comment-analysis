Well, this is never something you want
to see, but at the moment, this could be
being thrown. And of course, that is
going to stop. And that's not good
either because now the captain for
Turentina is pleading and the West Ham
players are going over to the fans just
to try and calm the situation down a
bit. It's never something you want to
see in football.
I think we've had a fan come onto the
pitch. So referee
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
Heat up here.
[Music]
Now they're being mobbed by his public
once again.
[Music]
He's just threatening to get a little
bit out of hand here as the fans come on
looking for selfies. He got grabbed
around the neck there as well. He's not
happy about that. Where's the security
by
[Applause]
[Music]
going to be championship goals? And he
obliges yet again.
Here's Ronaldo. He's got a goal from
nothing.
[Music]
Ronaldo looking for the hattick and he's
got it. Magnificent from Cristiano
Ronaldo. He has made the second half.
[Music]
and hit brilliantly
by who else? Declan Rice who is
restrained in his celebration of a sixth
goal for Arsenal.
[Music]
[Music]
They do. Give it up.
Heat. Heat.
of P. I wouldn't be surprised if there's
an announcement and we know what then
follows.
There we are. He's been hit. This is the
danger. A player could be hit. A player
could be injured by it. Hit on the head.
Absolutely disgraceful. Once again, Lia
is uh just turned into the gutter by the
idiots.
Well, this is disastrous moronic
behavior.
It really is.
Dimmitri pay spilled by a missile
and throw things back and Marles's
patience has finally snapped with the
home crowd who have constantly been
pelting them with missiles throughout
the game and it has turned into a highly
unsavory incident.
It has been constant, hasn't it? In this
second period when
Gonzalez is there just kicking the ball
into the crowd. Spectators bursting
through the security in the stadium.
Unable fighting now unable to control
it. Players from both sets, both teams.
A terrific day for you. But what
happened at the end? You seem to be
involved with a fan as well. Can you
tell us exactly what happened?
Yeah, obviously uh I suppose fans were
giving him some second half. I give him
some back.
He reacts. He gives him a little bit of
stick. You can see with Charison as well
gets involved. This is part of football
that you're always going to get a little
bit of stick. But for a fan to come and
do that, as we see it as it unfolds now
and come on to the and try and kick a a
player that's played on the pitch, it's
completely unacceptable. You go, he's
got to get his water bottle. He's got to
get his gloves. You can see now here
comes the fam. And I'm sure that Spurs
will act accordingly. That he should be
allowed in the football stadium. That
guy, he should not be allowed. and he's
he's completely out of order and
unacceptable.
Yeah, and I'm sure that is not the last
that fan will be hearing of that.
Mohamed Salah, well, he's learned the
lesson. He was supposed to take the
fifth penalty in the final of the Afa
Cup of Nations. He never got to take it.
This time he's making sure that he is
taking one. He's taking it first.
Salah then against Mendy and he's missed
it.
And he's met with a roar as if Sagal
have scored a goal from the home fans.
[Music]
out in Portugal.
And that is it. Two-0 it is to
Liverpool.
They don't concede the away goal.
Perhaps crucially,
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
other
delay to try and get in the Manchester
City striker's head. There's not much
interference with his mindset.
Harland. Oh,
he wasn't of the right mind that time.
Not just a miss. That is missed by a
distance.
Harland
off of Moano. He's on his backside and
Harland is through and he's not going to
miss another chance.
No way. Know how
Manchester City
now has an idiot come onto the pitch to
confront Ronaldo.
He's being escorted away by four
Stewarts.
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
Heat up
[Music]
here.
[Music]
It's snowing
Kish is trying to maintain a sense of
humor about it all.
Guess that's easier to do at 2-0 up.
Gish dealing with more hailstones and I
must say dealing with them with great
good humor.
[Music]
Well, he got something on it. It's
squeezed away but only as far as Hakim.
Here's Asencio in. They waited for their
moment. Flag stays down for the minutes.
It's in rolled in.
[Music]
[Applause]
Hey
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
They for
[Applause]
the last
hotel.
[Applause]
Then obviously the message got to Gareth
Southgate. He speaks to the UEFA
officials and we're now into step one
where the PA announces this has to stop
otherwise there might be further action.
heat.
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
This could be the most Amazing story of
the season.
[Applause]
Branding Vorn
like he's never been away.
The man in front of goal who is simply
deadly.
[Applause]
Heat. Heat.
