Today, whatever we build, we'll have to
buy. We have six different challenges to
see what will get each other. Round one.
Oh, WAIT. [screaming]
James gets to build whatever he wants,
and me and [music] Gabe have to buy it.
Hopefully, we can guess what it is. Good
luck, bro. I'm going to make it a little
harder for you.
Four legs. No, bro. You silly. Good
guess, though. He's building a Lego
house, but he wants us to buy him a real
house.
Super close, but smaller.
A playhouse. Closer. A little bigger.
You would go through here.
What am I doing? [panting]
Wo wo
bounce house. Yeah. Hey.
Oh my. Out of all the things you could
have built.
Yeah, but now we can all enjoy it.
All right, Gabe.
Let's go buy him a bounce house.
All right, we're almost there. Almost
there. And take out the blindfold.
We went a step further and we got one
with a slide. You didn't do the slide,
but we like, you know, slides are nice.
We got a slide.
You guys are the best friends I've ever
had. Oh my
Oh my god.
I can't wait to [music] jump in this
boy.
Didn't even take his shoes off.
Yo, come in, boys.
Oh, he's about to go down the slide. OH
MY GOD. [laughter]
[screaming]
ARE YOU GOOD?
You guys should have got a bigger one.
[laughter]
The slide is legit.
YEAH, DUDE.
What it say?
It's me.
Oh, this is going to be terrible.
Oh, dude. Wait, I only get one color.
One hue.
Ah,
this for me, not you.
Oh, he's doing tires. Four-wheeler
cyber truck.
No, he got it.
What? Really?
Yep. [laughter]
All right, we'll go get it.
Yeah, I'm going to build it just for fun
cuz I still want to build it, you know.
Here, use a fish.
There it is. That's my ATV. Looks
futuristic. Are you ready for your brand
new four-wheeler? Oh snap. That is
fresh.
Let me get a ride, dude. Let [music] me
get a ride. Bro, this is sick,
bro. It's literally just how I built it.
That's how it looks.
OH, IT'S QUICK.
OH MY GOSH. He's on two wheels.
It rides, boys. It rides.
All right, Gabe, pick a card. Any card.
Get a card.
Wait, boys. Listen.
It's me, [laughter]
bro. This is the worst one, too.
You build some Legos and um we're going
to try to just knock you in the face.
That's nice.
Oh my gosh.
One, two, three.
What are you building, bro? I'm done.
I'm done. That's it. That's it. That's
it. Oh my gosh. That was a brick. Wait,
are you real done?
Uh, yeah. So, this is the object I want.
This is just something that you would
like help you use it.
Bro, I'm so confused right now.
You want a Christmas tree and a couch?
So, because you didn't supply me with
[snorts] the correct colors, this would
be all black.
Oh my god. Gabe is the worst Lego
builder ever.
I think I know exactly what he wants.
I'm going to go get it. I'll be really
surprised if he gets it.
We got it.
I mean, it Yeah, it's a good guess. This
is what you want, right?
No, it's a TV.
What? Did you even check inside?
Dang. Thanks, bro.
Oh, that's not how that works,
Gabe. Oh, yeah. That's good. Let's make
it extra difficult for him. How?
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Oh. Oh.
blindfolded.
He can build whatever he wants. A car, a
house, a TV, but he's got to do it
blindfolded.
This really sucks. Yeah, this is going
to take like 8 years.
There we go. Wait, you're done?
He's done.
Oh, yeah. I can unb blindfold now,
right?
That's what you want.
It's a TV.
Yeah,
we can do a TV. I got it. I got I'm I
will put it down. I'll put it down.
Well, he said he was going to put it
down,
so I'm just conf I'm just Are you good,
bro?
4K OLED. Check it out.
Thanks, bro. I can finally watch our
videos.
Wait, you haven't been watching our
videos?
Yo, what
game? [screaming]
Yes.
That's bad, bro. We have to buy
Oh, dang. You know what? You know what?
We We can mess with him again,
dude. How do you [music] make it more
difficult?
Got you. I'll be right back. You got to
build the Legos in the back while I
drive.
You know, you don't have to give me
anything. It's It's fine.
He's just too excited, bro. He's pumped.
See him?
Are you 100% ready?
I think I know what I want. Yeah.
Hold on to your Legos. Here we go.
Oh, this feels so weird. I don't like
this.
YAY.
How's it going, GAME? WHAT ARE YOU
BUILDING? UM, WELL, IF I TOLD YOU, THEN
IT KIND OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE.
OH, I'm gonna get [screaming]
It's white. It's white. I saw it. I
wonder how bad he's struggling out
there. Like, you think it's hard?
[screaming]
OH NO. OH MY GOSH. OKAY, I'M DONE. I'm
done. Said he's done. What' you build?
Well, it's chairlike and it's all white.
What do you think it is?
A fridge. Toilet seat. Toilet seat or
toilet?
It's a toilet.
It's a toilet. I got small ones. So,
yeah.
All right, Gabe. Every toilet under the
sun. Just let me know what you want.
I don't know. This one claims it can
flush a bucket of golf balls. That's the
one I want. It's the only one that
claims that. Well, yeah. All right. You
You ready?
Should we just go get a cart? We Oh,
that's not that bad. Come on. Come on.
Oh, you should PICK THAT ONE. YES. I NO.
NO. DARN IT. OH, DON'T. I hope you don't
break the bank, bro.
I'm going to build whatever I want. But
there's a catch. I have to build the
Legos in the pool.
Am I Is it cold or something?
No. It feels great.
So, what you going to build, bro?
I can't tell you.
Bro, you going to build Spongebob's
house down there?
I'm going to make it harder. You got 20
seconds.
What?
How can we make this harder,
bro? This is already hard enough. I'm
literally building Legos underwater. We
spray him in the face with water.
There's a hose right here.
Hey, the the more you mess with me, the
longer this is going to take.
Is that bad for me or you?
It's bad for you.
But you're going to look like a raisin
afterwards.
It's raining.
I CAN'T SEE.
Looks like there's a 20% chance it will
rain, so be careful.
What do you think it is? Come on, give
me some guesses.
I can't even see it. It's underwater.
Great Wall of China.
A half gallon of BaskinRobins. Oh, dude,
that'd be fresh.
You You're getting there.
Bed frame. Bed frame. Bed frame. Oh,
goggles.
All right, I think it's done. You want
You want me to give you a hint?
Sure. Cuz right now I'm not looking at
much.
All right. Ready? Ready? Here. Hold on.
Hold on. Oh, I got to take it out of my
pocket. Oh, hello. Who is this?
Keys.
How do you not know what that is?
Dude, it's his mom. Your mom.
A flip phone. It's a flip phone.
No. No. You You're close. YOU'RE CLOSE.
BLACKBERRY.
NO. COME ON.
FINE. I'LL END YOUR TORTURE. Chocolate
bar.
I'm just going to get out of the bowl. I
don't think they're going to buy me what
they want.
It's a phone.
YES. IT'S A PHONE.
OH, IT'S [screaming] A PHONE. OH, WE
SHOULD HAVE GOT THAT. OH, we should get
him one of those phones that like the
dial and it spins. Are you peeing in the
pool?
Yeah.
Does he even deserve the phone now? So,
we kept it cool cuz obviously everyone
wants Apple. So, we got you an iPhone.
Yay. That's what I wanted. How good are
you at catching though?
I'm great. I used to play baseball.
I got you, bro.
You're welcome.
Hey, now you could call me on your cell
phone.
