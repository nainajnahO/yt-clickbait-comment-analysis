juvie for a prank they pulled on their
teacher what did they do to their
teacher they let the teacher desk on

time that you say no to these kids you
have to give them a 100 bucks that
sounds easy how hard could it be yeah
there what like all right well we're

backyard oh it's nice actually this is

thought we were on the same team now
that I think about it that was a pretty
good prank that was pry good it's cuz
you didn't fall on the pool the kids
were nice enough to let Drew shower but
we did not let our guard down I feel
like I'm getting pranked nothing in the
shower you shower we we'll watch the
kids all right I guess so right now
we're hiding from them Drew is taking a
shower who knows what they're going to

we heard Drew screaming from the
bathroom oh what
Drew what oh oh my God what did they
what did you put in the hairspray now

your wet wet soggy hun oh my God you the
100 get out of here let's get out we out
here we're out of here freaking glass
everywhere where's my clothes we left
the house so fast but before we drove
off we had an idea to prank them back
what if we get them back let's get the
police involved we have these police
friends that will help us arrest them
and they'll think they're actually
getting arrested it'll be the best prank
ever prank them back I mean at this
point though we can just call the real
police and like get arrested so we ran
their mom through the plan and she was
on board okay so there's a couple kids
in here we're trying to teach them a
little bit of a lesson they've been kind
of doing these like crazy nasty pranks
on us and so we were hoping that maybe
you can go in there and just kind of
fake arrest them and kind of give them a
little scare of what could happen let's
do it yeah
okay it's going to be so good
perfect what are you guys doing nothing
nothing what's this mess out here you
guys just walk around do whatever the
hell you guys want right pretty much
yeah that's it yeah do me favor let's go
set up get up turn you call the cops on
us yeah I did because you guys are out
of control sorry guys I hate you
