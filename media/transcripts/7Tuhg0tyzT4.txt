Nature is a cruel place where animals
must constantly fight for survival. Most
of the time, animals in the wild know
exactly who they can win a fight against
and what kind of animal they should
avoid at all costs. Sometimes, however,
animals do get a little too confident
and mess with the wrong opponent. Watch
this video till the end and you'll be
shocked. The silverback gorilla is one
of the strongest animals on the planet.
So when these massive and aggressive
gorillas started raging at the zoo,
these people were very thankful that the
bulletproof glass was there to keep them
safe.
No, no, no.
This curious dog learned its lesson the
hard way after attacking an electric
eel, only to get violently
zapped. He dies.
An overly confident tiger quickly
regrets trying to sneak up on a sloth
bear when it stands up to demonstrate
its dominance.

[Music]
protecting and caring for your family is
not only important for us humans, it's a
rule that applies to many animals on
this planet. So, when these baboons saw
one of their family members being
attacked by a huge crocodile, they all
jumped in to beat up the predator and
saved their friend who was in desperate
need of help.
[Music]
[Music]
Can we drive now? No.
This curious dog just wanted to mess
around with a kangaroo, but almost gets
drowned in the process.
[Music]
[Music]
Some cats seem to be completely fearless
and are never intimidated by larger
creatures, just like this cat chasing
away a bear.
These animals charge towards one another
after a long standoff. You will
certainly be surprised by the one left
[Music]
standing. When this lonely hyena
stumbled upon a pack of 20 wild dogs,
she immediately felt threatened and
called for backup.
In order for her call to travel as far
as possible, she lowered her head to the
ground before howling, making the sound
carry
further. When the backup finally
arrived, the wild dogs knew they
wouldn't stand a chance and quickly ran
off.
[Music]
Two hungry lions decided to team up to
prey on a buffalo, but didn't realize
the buffalo has friends, too.
[Applause]
[Applause]
When this buffalo saw a lion sneaking
around in the bushes and preparing to
attack, it decided to take the first
move and strike first.
This hyena learns the hard way what
happens if you steal food from lions. As
this male lion shows who's
[Music]
boss, this lion was cornered by hyenas
and desperately called for help while
fighting for her life.
And after managing to endure a long and
tough fight, her pack finally arrives
and comes to the
[Music]
[Music]
rescue. This 11-month-old leopard cub
got sniffed out by a hungry hyena and
had to make a desperate run for its
life. Luckily, it was spared from death
thanks to a nearby tree and its
excellent climbing abilities.
[Music]
Yes.
Yes. This is not how to wake up a
lioness.
[Music]
These cheetah cubs wanted a baby wthog
for dinner and tried to chase them down
until the vicious warthog parents came
to the rescue and started chasing the
cheetahs
[Music]
instead. Come here.
[Music]
Sometimes it's not about being the
biggest. You also have to have
confidence. Just like this duck messing
with a pack of hungry tigers.
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
Huh? Heat.
[Music]
Seems like ducks really love messing
with tigers because here's another
[Music]
one. And here's yet another case where
confidence beats size.
This northern water snake thought an eel
would be an excellent and effortless
dinner, but the eel wanted to live
another day and fought its way to
freedom.
[Music]
Despite being surrounded by several
lions trying to take him down, he was
still able to resist and survive while
also doing just as much damage towards
[Music]
them. rhino who is all bark and no bite.
Oh. Oh my lord.
Apparently, humans aren't the only
species capable of trolling because this
monkey decided to bully two tigers by
swinging down and pinching their ears.
[Music]
Hey, Mommy.
[Music]
Get away from
me. This rhino chose an opponent in a
completely different weight division,
and the elephant had to teach it a
lesson and show who's the real king of
the savannah. Oh my god, baby.
[Music]
This is
[Music]
white. Even though cats are pretty small
animals, they are also one of the most
confident. Just check out this cat
exerting her dominance against two
tigers.
[Music]
This may be the same duck we saw
earlier. If so, he sure loves going
around different places and messing with
tigers.
[Music]
[Music]
Did I kill me?
[Music]
If you still don't think the wilderness
is a cruel place after all we've seen so
far, you will definitely think so after
watching this next part. This video
shows a male bear attacking a female in
order to eliminate her cubs. Male bears
will sometimes do this in order to mate
with the mother, who will only do so if
she doesn't have any babies to care for.
But this time, the bigger and stronger
dad was close by and quickly came to the
rescue.
[Music]
[Applause]
When hyenas fight together in a pack,
they become very dangerous. So when they
tried to steal food from these
lionesses, they struggled to fight back.
But when the king of the jungle came
running to the rescue, the enemy knew
they had to back down.
[Music]
[Applause]
