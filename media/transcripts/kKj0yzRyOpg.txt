them the drinks are on the Cubbies this
is perfect for my plan wait what is she
doing with the care packages is she
stealing from the care packages this kid
really is evil a strict teacher needs to
know when a kid is not being trustworthy
so we're going to do the trust challenge
each of you will pick attakus or I to
knock the cup off your head who do you
trust I don't think adus is as strong as
Matt so I would pick adus

open care packages okay while they're
distracted opening the care packages
