discourage illegal parking
an angry farmer flipped over a car that
was illegally parked on his
property ORS be cared be cared out ORS
be cared
out look moral of the story don't bring
a cell phone to a forklift
fight it's safe to say say that this guy
thought the other driver parking didn't
quite make the cut so he generously lent
him a hand
[Music]
all I can say is don't mess with a
Wrangler
[Music]
what worries me the most is that people
like this also have the right to
[Music]
vote as the saying goes revenge is best
serve
cold as much as I hate to admit it
despite Grandma's efforts this driver
only needs to take out two or three bins
to pull out
speaking of pulling
[Music]

like this ridiculous ulous ridiculous
ridiculous do us all a favor and throw
away the keys once you're
