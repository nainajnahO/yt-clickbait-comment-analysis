The reason we all love watching sports is
because it can be so unpredictable, and that
means the cameras sometimes get the chance
to capture some really funny moments.
Today we’ve collected some of the most amusing
and ridiculous moments from all kinds of sports.
So get ready, because it’s impossible to
watch this video without smiling!
By the way, if you haven’t subscribed to

Let’s get it on!
Own goals are always seriously entertaining
but also so painful to watch.
But this own goal might just be the worst
one ever.
Getting an own goal has to be worse for the
person whose only job is to keep balls out
of the goal - especially when he’s just
gone to all the effort of saving one.
I’m not sure how this French goalkeeper
forgot to let go of the ball, but it was a
disaster for him.
It actually looks like he thinks he saved
it at the last second, but that was wishful
thinking - it was definitely an own goal.
In sports, it’s always wise to keep certain
people on your side - like the people who
have the power to determine your score.
For example, you should definitely never ever
hit the chair umpire in the face with a ball
in the middle of a tennis match.
It was definitely an accident and everyone
rushed to the 17 year old’s defence, but
it sure cost him.
Before being taken to hospital, the umpire
declared a default, sending his opponents
to the Semi-Finals.
On the bright side, at least he didn’t hit
the cute ball boy who was standing under the
umpire’s chair and was so quick to duck.
There are mistakes, and then there are moments
like this.
Johann Zarco was on course to take 7th place
at this MotoGP race, when an unexpected nightmare
occurred - he ran out of fuel.
How does that happen at a professional event
like this?
I have no idea.
Everyone must have felt pretty stupid, but
he’s a true sportsman and decided to just
run his Yamaha over the finish line and watch
as people who had crashed earlier in the race
managed to pass him.
He looked completely exhausted by the end,
but at least he got a point.
The first day of practice in F1 is all about
calmly checking that everything’s in order
and every part of your car is working properly.
And this is why that’s necessary.
Before you ask, no, the car didn’t hit anything
except maybe a bug, but probably not even
that.
Turns out, they were trialling a new suspension
component on this car…
I don’t know much about vehicles, but I’m
willing to say I’m pretty sure it didn’t
work.
He probably would’ve preferred to find that
out at a slightly slower speed than 180 mph,
but there were no injuries so who can complain.
Celebrating a goal is absolutely fine - you
deserve it, have fun!
Although you might want to check first that
your goal was actually a goal.
Kerem Bulut was offside when he got the ball
into the net, but he never stopped running
to find that out.
He just kept going, cheering and jumping up
and down all by himself, and hugging the spectators
who I guess were just humouring him.
He came back down to earth pretty quick once
he realised he’d been celebrating nothing
though.
Always expect the unexpected when you’re
in sports - but still, nobody could’ve seen
this coming, could they?
This university runner was all set to win
this 800m race, when the pole vaulter next
to the track made a mistake.
Imagine his confusion when one second he’s
winning, and the next moment he’s all tangled
up like an animal in a net.
The best part about this clip though is the
commentator who’s loving it and keeps insisting
that Spider Man had something to do with this
strange event.
Well Spider Man or no Spider Man, they let
the guy go to the finals.
There are plenty of people out there that
came last in every race on school athletics
days that will sympathise with this runner.
Sogelau Tuvalu wanted to compete in the shot-put
category in the IAAF but he didn’t qualify
- so instead of just going home, he joined
in the 100m race.
As you can see, it’s not really his strength,
and he achieved the slowest time in the history
of sprinting - 15.66 seconds.
It seems like a terrible idea, but he became
a kind of hero to the crowd who were cheering
him on much more than the winner!
Professional football is one of the most difficult
careers to get into - it’s a highly competitive
world so you just know that everyone involved,
even the linesmen and referees are the best
of the best.
And that makes little errors like this so
much more funny.
It’s not even like he wasn’t looking!
He saw where he was spraying that line and
thought “Yep, that’s right where I wanted
it” and kept going!
Those players don’t look too impressed - the
referee was probably lucky that’s vanishing
spray or he might’ve got one of those shoes
stuck somewhere unpleasant.
There’s dedication to your sport, and then
there’s serious dedication to your sport.
This hurdle race saw a serious battle to the
finish line by two runners from the Texas
A&M team.
Either teammate stood a chance of winning,
right up until the moment Infinite Tucker
decided to take off and fly over the finish
line like Spider Man.
It’s pretty impressive, but unfortunately
for him, he didn’t actually have superpowers.
He did win though, and I guess, when you think
about it, your face isn’t that important
The world of sports is fraught with danger
- it waits around every corner, like a snake
poised to pounce from the place you least
expect it.
So you better keep your eyes open, even if
you’re not one of the players.
You never know what might happen - for example,
you might just forget where you put your scalding
hot cup of coffee.
This is a reminder that it’s good to never
get too worked up about things.
Stop and smell the coffee, and you might avoid
burns on your butt.
If there was a competition for the most incredible
shot if it had gone in the right basket, this
one would be the winner.
There’s a huge scramble to defend the basket
which amazingly ends up being successful…
and then this disaster happens.
All James Young is trying to do is stop the
ball from going out of bounds, and he never
in a million years would’ve imagined that
he could get it in the basket if he throws
it behind himself without looking.
It’s a genuinely great shot, but still,
wrong basket.
The crowd still went wild though.
It’s probably best to stick to your own
sport most of the time.
Alex Rodriguez might have been a New York
Yankees star, but give him a football and
he seems to be more like a bull in a china
shop.
Although, maybe this wasn’t really his fault
- which producer had the idea of letting the
presenters throw footballs around a set full
of monitors?
This was bound to happen, right?
What they needed was someone’s mom on set
to tell them not to throw balls indoors, then
it never would have happened.
It’s not just humans who enjoy sports - you’ve
probably played fetch with a dog at least
once, for example.
Most animals don’t try to go pro though,
and who can blame them when nobody’s willing
to put animals on a team.
But this squirrel had a dream, and it wasn’t
going to let anyone stand in its way.
It was going to prove it could run with the
best of them.
And it sure can!
There’s a touchdown!
Perfect play from the unknown squirrel!
It’s just a matter of time before it gets
signed with a display like that!
This will make a lot of you feel better about
your luck: it turns out, even basketball stars
sometimes embarrass themselves in front of
beautiful women.
Nigel Hayes obviously didn’t realise his
microphone was quite so sensitive when he
revealed his thoughts about a reporter in
a whisper to his teammate.
Obviously something about the looks on everyone’s
face told him he made a mistake.
The poor guy probably could’ve styled it
out if he’d thought fast - after all, it’s
a sweet thing to say!
But he just ended up with his head in his
hands while his friends giggled at him.
When you find yourself in the middle of the
action, it’s vital you keep your eyes on
both your
opponents and your teammates.
That’s a whole lot of looking to do, so
it must get difficult, but
that’s no excuse for taking your eye off
the ball.
Never presume it is where you left it, or
you end
up looking like this.
At that level, kicking blindly into the air
when the ball is behind you is just too
funny, you’ll have to work hard to regain
proper respect after that.
Always be sure to look at the
ball before you kick.
