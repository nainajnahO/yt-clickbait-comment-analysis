These are the dumbest criminals caught
on camera. It's hard to believe this
actually happened. This criminal took
his time to hide his face from the
cameras he knew were watching him. But
halfway through his attempted breakin,
he took a quick peep to see if the
[music] camera was still watching. It
was.
These thieves did their research. They
even knew where the security cameras
were. At least they thought they did.
Go, go, go.
Sometimes a little bit of pre-planning
can save you a lot of time and effort.
[music]
Oh man. After catching a glimpse of
himself in the mirror, this thief
decided today wasn't a good day to break
the law. [screaming]
When you're outsmarted and get locked in
the very store you're trying to rob, you
know it's game over. This was the
world's easiest arrest for these
policemen.
Here we go again. Of all disguises you
can wear to fool a CCTV, what would you
rate as the worst? You think a plastic
bag would be up there with other
terrible ideas? These criminals made a
spectacular entrance to this electronic
store, only to fail miserably on the
exit. Someone give their window cleaner
a raise.
Medic,
I've heard of hiding goods under your
hoodie for inconspicuous shoplifting,
but this is on a whole other level. Boy,
some people will try and steal anything.
Like this hairbrain guy who thought no
one would notice a chainsaw hidden under
his t-shirt.
I am a super genius.
This furry burglar got in her full getup
for this home invasion. Except she got a
little hot at one point and exposed
herself on camera.
[music] When he stole a bunch of
packages off someone's front porch, he
rewarded police with a little victory
dance and his full face on camera.
Thank you very much.
When you have a sweet tooth calling,
only 300 gumballs will do. This criminal
severely overestimated the size of his
target.
Bye. Have a great time. [music]
The worst place you can possibly try and
steal something is a police station.
This guy didn't get the memo and found
himself at the receiving end of a
red-handed arrest. This guy thought the
best way to rob a jewelry store was by
walking in the front door and smashing
display cabinets with a rock. He didn't
count on the reinforced glass and ran
out empty-handed. NO. [screaming]
These three guys do a pretty good job
distracting the store clerk while their
friend steals two phones at the back. It
should have been the perfect crime,
except for the CCTV capturing their
every move. Busted.
This thief had it all worked out. He'd
ran sack a phone store in the middle of
the night. Everything was going great.
A few moments later
until he realized he was now trapped
inside the store he was trying to flee.
Suspect is in custody.
Armed robberies usually work better when
you have an actual weapon, not just
[music] a finger under your shirt. While
he might have made off with $300, he
showed his face on camera and was
quickly arrested.
This This is not okay. [music] This
needs to stop now. The first rule in
stealing something is leaving with it in
one piece. Judging by their performance,
it's no surprise they were caught just a
day later.
When you try to rob a locked beer
fridge, it will always leave you feeling
a little crushed.
Sometimes the person who steals your
packages is the person living right next
door to you.
After a lengthy foot race, this genius
chose the wrong path that ended up going
nowhere fast. At least he got some good
exercise.
Come on. [screaming]
Another day, another ATM theft attempt.
This genius forgot to tie the rope to
his truck.
This guy doesn't even care that it's
broad daylight. He just goes ahead and
climbs into the car as though it's his.
Once he realizes all that was useless,
he just gives up and walks away. Cool.
This Daredevil didn't count on two guard
dogs who were trained to defend their
property.
Sometimes that chicken looks so good you
just have to help yourself to a serving
of your own. Unfortunately for him, it
didn't go unnoticed.
You need to leave.
This late night trespasser spent forever
smashing and climbing his way through a
glass door when he could have just
reached around and let himself in.
[music]
When you go on a beer run, always
remember to pay and tighten your belt or
this happens.
No, no, no, no.
This guy thought he'd try the oldest
trick in the book. Try on some expensive
jewelry and run out the front door. It's
clear the owners had trouble with
thieves before.
Can't handle the heat, my friend.
Not even priceless art is safe from dumb
thieves. This man thought he could hide
a painting under his jacket and simply
stroll out of a gallery unnoticed.
I'm a bad boy.
Bike thieves aren't afraid of daylight
robbery, even from the back of your car.
This rear dash cam captured the very
unsuccessful attempt from a very unaware
criminal. Armed robberies work best when
you can [music] keep your weapon firmly
in your hand. This robber practically
handed the clerk his gun before running
out kung fu style.
After being arrested and detained for
questioning, this teen was left alone
for mere seconds before making this
daring second floor escape. Too bad the
cops already have your name. This guy
was determined to get into a locked door
without a key. He spent almost 3 hours
trying to kick the door in only to get
absolutely nowhere. Wait till he figures
out he just needs to pull the door
instead. Good gravy. This genius tried
to steal a display bike from a bicycle
shop. Not only was he not quick enough,
but the bike he was trying to steal had
no pedals.
Mission failed. We'll get him next time.
Normally, thieves climb fences to steal
what's secured behind them. This guy
wanted to steal the whole gate itself.
[music]
Every now and then, porch pirates strike
gold. Like this one who found a TV on
someone's doorstep. If only he'd planned
ahead with a car big enough to carry it.
These mallet wielding maniacs have never
heard of reinforced glass. You got to
give them points for effort, though. At
one point, you got to cut your losses
and run.
This thief was trying to steal
electrical cables from a high-rise when
he became trapped on top of an air
conditioning unit four floors up. After
two days stuck, he was eventually helped
to safety. When this crook managed to
reach through and grab a cash register
tray, he thought he hit payday, but his
spatial awareness [music] could use some
work.
When this guy decided to steal a
mattress, he was just lucky it was there
to cushion his awkward fall just seconds
later.
What seemed like a flawless break-in was
followed up by the worst getaway ever.
It's almost hard to believe that this
actually happened. When a single kebab
wasn't enough, this guy tried to steal
the whole roll. When the police finally
caught up to the truck, the reason for
them running became pretty obvious.
What good is a brazen ram raid robbery
if you only steal worthless display
models instead of the hundreds of brand
new boxed iPhones out back?
Oh no. When you've been robbed multiple
times, sometimes leaving a trap is the
best way to catch a criminal. This
locked corridor served as the perfect
cage for an unwanted thief. [music]
This guy would do anything for a Pepsi.
Anything except pay, that is. And when
the doors locked behind him, he figured
100 shoulder barges would do the trick.
This man used his kid for cover while he
hid a stolen laptop down his pants. I
guess some people have no shame.
[whistles]
I think we can confidently say that the
mystery of the missing house plants has
finally been solved.
These criminals must have thought there
were some Mission Impossible style
lasers defending this bar when they
broke in. There weren't lasers, but
there were cameras recording their every
wormlike move. After robbing a travel
agent, Mother Nature did her best at
slowing down this criminal as much as
possible. And just like that, his money
was gone with the wind. A little help,
please. You can tell [music] times are
tough when people are out there stealing
lawn furniture. These two thieves were
captured on camera stealing a bench from
the porch of a family's house. After
this thief broke into a computer store,
he quickly discovered that anti- theft
cables exist. Looks like he might just
leave empty-handed.
Denied.
All this guy wanted to do was look at a
$17,000 wedding ring in sunlight. But
instead of returning inside, he simply
walked away. Luckily, camera footage was
able to identify him.
ATM thieves aren't the sharpest tools in
the shed. These ones managed to jimmy
open the front panel of this ATM before
getting spooked and driving away. These
two shoe thieves were picking the best
footwear to steal before they were
caught and made their escape.
