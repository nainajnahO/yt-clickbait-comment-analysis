what Joy
cebergs
[Music]
[Music]
all right
[Music]
[Applause]
at the end of the game
completely let his emotions go there and
he sees the red card and rightly so
rightly so I don't know what he can
complain about that
[Music]
take this corner
obviously Nicholas moysander has been
told to follow Chicharito wherever he
goes and his voice under keeps on going
he'll end up with the wrong changing
room the best marking I've ever seen
although fewer minutes and he would have
liked by the looks of it doesn't look
very happy at being taken off there for
Renato Sanchez
having a bit of a chuckle at the expense
of I and Robin just consoling him he's
gonna miss five minutes of football
defender's a bit slow and getting back
Judah outrageous
well the decibel levels in The zignali
Duda Park are growing to ear splitting
level as Mario getzer warms up in front
of the zoo tribuna whether that was such
a good idea by the former Dortmund star
might be a better idea to warm up
somewhere else and that's something he's
former coach in Mentor Jurgen klopp
could have told him
now was there
well where is the keeper where's the
goalkeeper Mark Bracken is non-existent
and goalkeeper Mark flacken was drinking
water he didn't see anything put the
icing on the cake
flat back a hit for six and it's some
response from Borussia Dortmund
following that dismantilation that they
were on the end of from ranges see the
penny
[Applause]
it's an absolute aberration what was he
thinking Lucas radetsky as he just lost
his bearings or is
both he's panicked the slip 30 made a
massive difference
[Applause]
[Music]
um
again
well
what an incredible save plenty of
support
absolutely extraordinary
thank you
that tells you whether it's a goal or
not with a gold mine technology
[Music]
it's incredible how on Earth did Robert
Lewandowski not get his 41st goal of the
Season there
let's play against by David cousin
Philip kostich two ghosts and then this
is last three
okay
oh what a curious
Peterson
is going to put the ball into the mix
dangerous and every and oh my goodness
one of the most shocking on goals you'll
see this season out here this is Stefano
chill out what a cow but is it wrong
next
calling Corner can't believe it I can't
believe it either one of the best girls
you're gonna see for a long time but in
the wrong Max
[Applause]
of the Season
well what disappointment
yeah
yeah what a goal
Kristoff Kramer scores one of the most
Sensational goals we'll see for a long
time
well well that's the end of front
ribbery's involvement this afternoon
it's been a really frustrating game for
him
released by David Oliver and
a bad decision
but he's full of police carved down to
well-deserved reputation as a fiery
character Ribery
this time last eight Rings got in
offline free he's gonna be two this
Mystics
then oh you don't want to sit there like
that like your colleagues are gonna take
a pot shot for missing such an easy
chance
down the pitch as he can there's nothing
left
oh goodness maybe that's gonna be an
absolute
how did he not manage to put that one in
well we're going to be looking at that
one on the internet for a very long time
it doesn't matter but that's certainly
gonna go down as one of the misses of
the season oh my gosh Patrick have you
ever seen the like
one of the best strikers in the league
heading besides to goal from I don't
know two meters distance that's
unbelievable but it happens and it
doesn't matter at all
thank you
[Music]
