in the animal kingdom most animals are
aware of who they can beat in a fight
for survival and who they should avoid
at all costs but sometimes animals
simply mess with a wrong opponent and
have to suffer the consequences watch
this video till the end and you'll be
shocked a curious dog learned a hard
lesson the hard way when meeting an
electric heel only to get violently
Zapped and whimper away in agony
when a rude and Rowdy elephant kicked a
resting buffalo in the face the elephant
quickly regretted its foolish decision
when the Buffalo retaliated by poking
him right in the rear with its
horn wrong place at the wrong time for
this defenseless baby chick that gets
snapped up and eaten by a Hungry Horse
like a tasty
snack super this is why you should never
turn your back on a
[Music]
tiger when a mom and baby rhino had an
altercation with three elephants at a
watering hole the elephants displayed
that they are the most intelligent by
using inanimate objects As Weapons to
scare them
[Music]
away not even a fence can stop these
sheep from fighting
this dog's bark is definitely worse than
its bite as it Retreats like a coward
after messing with a massive
iguana when a group of predatory Birds
tried to snatch one of this leopard's
Cubs the mother had to teach them a hard
lesson
[Music]
did this bird just travel through
time I think this dog got what he
deserved a group of wild dogs were
hanging out at a watering hole when they
were suddenly joined by a huge elephant
who wanted the place for himself watch
how he tries to drive the little
Annoying creatures off his lawn by
kicking dirt at them chasing them around
and showing them who's
[Music]
boss a mountain lion decided to attack a
lone baby bear instead of its big mother
but had an embarrassing defeat as the
little bearca bravely fought It Off
[Applause]
the animals in the jungle have many
differences but they all share one
common enemy The Lion so when this
Buffalo was being attacked by the hungry
Predator a heroic elephant stepped in to
save its
[Music]
life when a black bear wandered into the
wrong territory a very unusual fight
occurred as a male lion decided to drive
the animal away from its
land a tiny dog quickly regretted
messing with the teu lizard when it
suddenly had enough of its annoying
barking and decided to teach it lesson
the hard
[Music]
way elephants know that they are the
absolute strongest when they stick
together so when two crocodiles were
threatening some of these elephants the
whole herd decided to charge at the
dangerous enemies together to scare them
away oh no oh
oh the little one's got some BS this dog
quickly regrets messing with an
impatient
donkey Lions usually know which animals
they can hunt and win against in a fight
but this lion got a little too confident
when it tried to attack a big
giraffe this lion cub was so eager to
bite into the Pride's meal that it got
stuck in a sticky situation to say the
least luckily the other Lions ate
through the Buffalo stomach and were
eventually able to set the pork cup free
this lion who was craving some honey
quickly regretted its Choice when it got
attacked by a swarm of vicious
[Music]
bees dude I think you knocked it
out when a grizzly bear was feeding on
its prey a pack of hungry wolves
surrounded the animal and tried to steal
it but the bear refused to hand over his
food for which he had fought so bravely
and showed the wolf WF pack who's
[Music]
boss this prairie falcon uses it
hard-hitting hunting tactic to take out
a clueless Drake malard with a
high-speed head
shot he didn't even give him time to
[Music]
duck this mountain lion probably
confused itself with a regular lion when
it tried to hunt a much bigger alpaca
who bravely fought off the desperate
animal
[Music]
there is a hugee difference in size
between a cow and a goat so when these
animals charge towards each other after
a long standoff you will definitely be
surprised by the one left
[Music]
standing a hungry leopard stalks a
warthog right before snatching its baby
but what the leopard didn't know was
that it messed with her wrong mother who
wasn't going to give up easily on its
[Music]
child this cow hit his head so hard that
he switched
[Music]
personalities a clueless raccoon
accidentally got in the wrong hood and
had to pay the consequences as these
chimpanzees were not too happy about
having an
[Music]
intruder these sharks work together to
mug the crocodiles and steal their food
but one of the Sharks receives Instant
Karma
too apparently pigs can fly just check
out this wild boar that shows that
nothing is impossible
[Music]
a fisherman caught an electric heel but
as he's pulling it in an alligator
decided he wanted a piece of the action
to and got himself a little bit more
than a
bite up to 860 volts of electricity
suddenly flowed through the alligator's
body and the eel's unusual defense
mechanism completely obliterates the
animal when a male lion attacked a
leopard the female lion surprisingly
chose to defend the defenseless
animal who do you think would win in a
fight between a crab and a scorpion well
in this epic underwater battle the crab
completely destroyed its opponent
[Music]
strength and size aren't always the most
important traits to have in nature
sometimes all you need is confidence to
beat the bigger opponent which this
Fearless go proved when it took on
several rhinos in a fight and
won African wild dogs may not be that
dangerous when they are alone but when
these animals fight together they are
some of the absolute scariest creatures
of the Savannah so when a pack of
vicious wild dogs attack this lioness it
knew it was in deep
[Music]
[Applause]
trouble when a massive of Eagle decided
that this goat would become its
delicious dinner the poor animal stood
no chance and was Swept Away to be never
seen again
[Music]
an overconfident Buffalo thought he
could beat a rhino in a fight but
underestimated its opponent and suffered
the brutal
[Music]
consequences this bear cub is using
worldclass wrestling to take down a dog
bigger than
himself watch out watch out watch
[Music]
out imagine when that bear grows up he's
definely going to be the king of the
[Music]
forest when a leopard and a hyena were
fighting over who would get the prey for
dinner the prey made an Oscar worthy
performance in order to
[Music]
escape at about 2 years of age M Lions
reach maturity and often begin picking
fights with their father eventually the
father grows tired of having his
authority questioned and forces the
younger males out of their territory in
this clip you can see this phenomenon
occur as a father and his son savagely
fight for dominance
[Applause]
[Music]
this alligator definitely mess with the
wrong guy hey get off here hey M you're
going to break his neck man freaky stop
you're going to break your brother's
neck a baffled cat didn't expect to be
completely outsmarted by a careless bird
this baboon should probably figure out a
better Escape Plan next time it gets
hunted by a pride of hungry Lions let me
tell you something let me tell you
something let me tell you something this
prank mantis was lucky that the massive
tarantula spider wasn't in the mood for
fighting as it would have easily
destroyed the annoying
[Music]
creature an Impala who was chased by a
pack of wild dogs later got stuck on on
a small island in the middle of a
watering hole as it then became the
target of a bunch of hungry crocodiles
in an attempt to escape the Impala
lunges itself into the water with a
crocodile getting closer and closer but
all of a sudden a heroic hippo appears
out of nowhere attacking the predator
and saving the poor
Antelope hippo coming INRI
