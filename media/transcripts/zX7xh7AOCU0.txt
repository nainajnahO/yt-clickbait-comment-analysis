Could not retrieve a transcript for the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX7xh7AOCU0! This is most likely caused by:

This video is age-restricted. Therefore, you are unable to retrieve transcripts for it without authenticating yourself.

Unfortunately, Cookie Authentication is temporarily unsupported in youtube-transcript-api, as recent changes in YouTube's API broke the previous implementation. I will do my best to re-implement it as soon as possible.

If you are sure that the described cause is not responsible for this error and that a transcript should be retrievable, please create an issue at https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api/issues. Please add which version of youtube_transcript_api you are using and provide the information needed to replicate the error. Also make sure that there are no open issues which already describe your problem!
